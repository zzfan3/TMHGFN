# TMHGFN
ntroduction
TMHGFN is a network framework designed to handle multimodal data with a temporal dimension. This method leverages the strengths of intra-modal hypergraphs and inter-modal temporal information to enhance the classification of sequential data.

Key Features
Intra-modal Hypergraphs: Utilizes hypergraphs within individual modalities to capture complex relationships.
Inter-modal Temporal Information: Incorporates temporal information across different modalities for improved data fusion.
Temporal Modeling: Full temporal modeling ensures robust sequential data classification.
Datasets
AudioSet: A public dataset used for evaluating audio-related models.
FMF: A self-built dataset including current, image, video, and multimodal learning data.
Setup
Install dependencies:

bash
复制代码
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Model:

bash
复制代码
python main.py
